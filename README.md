# ETL_Project

This repository contains files for a project for the University of Denver Data Analytics Bootcamp.  For this projct, I extracted data from the St. Louis Federal Reserve's research-oriented FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data), cleaned, organized and ran some calculations on the data using python in Jupyter Notebook, and loaded the data into a PostgreSQL database.  

I will be using the database I have created for extensive independent research and future projects within this bootcamp.
